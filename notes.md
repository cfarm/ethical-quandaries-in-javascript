  > Recipients must only request location information when necessary. Recipients must only use the location information for the task for which it was provided to them. Recipients must dispose of location information once that task is completed, unless expressly permitted to retain it by the user. Recipients must also take measures to protect this information against unauthorized access. If location information is stored, users should be allowed to update and delete this information.
